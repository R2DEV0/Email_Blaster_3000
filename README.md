Updated email blaster for a user friendly experience. Python (work in progress)

I created this application to make my job easier while working for Keltrans Freight Solutions. We have to copy and paste roughly 50 emails at a time to reach out to potential carriers for our shipments to not get blocked. This application can take in as many emails as you want and it will email each one individually keeping you from getting blocked and cuts back on time.
